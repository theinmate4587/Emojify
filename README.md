# Emojify
will implement a model which inputs a sentence (such as "Let's go see the baseball game tonight!") and finds the most appropriate emoji to be used with this sentence (⚾️). In many emoji interfaces, you need to remember that ❤️ is the "heart" symbol rather than the "love" symbol. 
We will start with a baseline model (Emojifier-V1) using word embeddings, then build a more sophisticated model (Emojifier-V2) that further incorporates an LSTM.
